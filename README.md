# FashionMNIST Classifier Model

This repository contains code for training a deep neural network to classify images from the FashionMNIST dataset. The dataset consists of grayscale images of fashion items categorized into 10 classes.

## Model Architecture

The neural network architecture consists of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling and ReLU activation functions. It is then followed by fully connected layers with ReLU activations and a softmax output layer.
